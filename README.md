BeatTracker
===========

David Grunberg's BeatTracker implemented for use with Mark Koh's DARwIn-OP Dance Synthesis project.

Ideally I would like to clean up this code a LOT so that it's easier to replicate and use the BeatTracker.  Currently it's extremely messy and difficult to trace what is going on.

Please not that to run this you will need to have PortAudio installed. If you don't have it, go to http://www.portaudio.com/ and get it.
You may compile the program using make:
    
    $make
    
This compiles to ./BeatTrackerApp

Any questions, please contact Mark (mkoh@drexel.edu) or David(dkg34@drexel.edu).
